"""Shared scaffolding for built-in experiment loggers.

Built-in loggers are ordinary :class:`~libreyolo.training.callbacks.TrainCallback`
objects layered on top of the public hook system. Two rules apply to all of
them:

- A missing backend package fails loudly at construction time (the user
  explicitly asked for the logger, so a silent no-op would hide a bug).
- A backend failure at runtime (server down, auth expired, ...) is logged
  once and the logger disables itself — it must never kill a training run.
